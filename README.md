#Problem Domain
The problem of process scheduling arises in operating systems, where multiple processes compete for CPU time. Efficient process scheduling ensures fair resource allocation, reduces waiting time, improves CPU utilization, and enhances system throughput. The goal is to simulate scheduling algorithms to evaluate their performance under different workloads.

Solution Domain
This project implements a Process Scheduler with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter in Python. It simulates the following scheduling algorithms:

First Come First Serve (FCFS)
Shortest Job First (SJF)
Round Robin (RR)
Priority Scheduling
Multilevel Feedback Queue (MFQ)
Earliest Deadline First (EDF)
The GUI allows users to input process data, select a scheduling algorithm, and visualize results.

Requirements
Software
Python: Version 3.8+
Libraries:
tkinter (for GUI development)
matplotlib (optional, for Gantt chart visualization)
numpy and tabulate (optional, for numerical calculations and tabular display)

Hardware
A standard computer system capable of running Python programs.

Data Structure Used
List: To store and manipulate process data like arrival time, burst time, priority, and deadlines.
Dictionary: To map process attributes to process IDs for easy referencing.
Queue: For implementing algorithms like Round Robin and Multilevel Feedback Queue.

Process Scheduler
Problem Domain
Efficient scheduling of processes is a critical aspect of operating systems. The challenge lies in managing CPU allocation to multiple processes while optimizing key performance metrics like waiting time, turnaround time, and system throughput. This project addresses these challenges by implementing multiple scheduling algorithms.

Shortest Job First (SJF)
Round Robin (RR)
Priority Scheduling
Multilevel Feedback Queue (MFQ)
Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)
Earliest Deadline First (EDF)

Methodology
Steps to Implement:
Input Collection:
GUI accepts user input for process details (e.g., arrival time, burst time, priority, deadline, and time quantum).
Algorithm Selection:
User selects one of the seven scheduling algorithms:
FCFS: Executes processes in the order of their arrival.
SJF: Selects the process with the shortest burst time.
RR: Cyclically executes processes using a fixed time quantum.
Priority Scheduler: Executes processes based on priority values.
MFQ: Uses multiple queues with different scheduling algorithms for different priority levels.
RMS: A static priority algorithm for real-time systems, prioritizing shorter periods.
EDF: A dynamic scheduling algorithm that prioritizes processes closest to their deadlines.

Process Execution Simulation:
Simulates process execution based on the selected algorithm.
Metric Calculation:
Calculates key metrics like:
Waiting Time (WT)
Turnaround Time (TAT)
Response Time (RT)
Displays the results in a user-friendly tabular format.
Visualization:
Gantt charts for visual representation of process execution (if enabled).
Output Display:
Results and visualizations are displayed on the GUI.

System Context (SC):
Input Module: Takes process data and algorithm selection from the user.
Processing Module: Executes the scheduling algorithm, calculates metrics, and generates results.
Output Module: Displays metrics and visualizations on the GUI.
Conclusion
This Process Scheduler project provides an interactive and educational platform for understanding and analyzing different CPU scheduling algorithms. By integrating a GUI, the project ensures user-friendly interaction, making it accessible for students, educators, and system designers.

The implementation of advanced algorithms like EDF, RMS, and MFQ makes this project particularly relevant for exploring real-time and multi-level scheduling scenarios.
